Version 1.4.1 - released 22-12-2012

* Support versions 1.4.5 and later of Bukkit, which had a breaking change in its
  API (specifically, the mapping of cardinal directions to coordinate axes was
  rotated).

Version 1.4 - released 15-12-2012

* The plugin now supports sound effects! If the SpoutPlugin plugin is installed
  on the server, and the user logs in with Spoutcraft, sound effects will be
  played whenever a portcullis is hoisted or dropped. For details about
  SpoutPlugin and Spoutcraft, see http://www.spout.org/.

  *Note:* the default sound effects are tuned for the default hoisting and
  dropping speeds. For this reason the sound effects are turned off by default
  if you have customised the hoisting or dropping speed. You can force the sound
  effects to be enabled by adding the line "soundEffects: true" to the
  config.yml file. You will probably also want to provide your own customised
  sound effects in this case. See
  http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/portecoulissante/pages/configuration/ for
  details.
* Support for new Minecraft 1.4 block types has been added.
* Java 5 is no longer supported.

Version 1.3 - released 5-8-2012

* A default config.yml file is now always created whenever the plugin is loaded
  and there isn't one yet, to cut down on confusion and draw attention to the
  configuration possibilities.
* Added new option to restrict power blocks (the frame blocks through which the
  redstone power is delivered to the portcullis) to certain types of block. This
  achieves a few goals:
  - Make it more difficult to build portculisses by having to use scarce
    resources in building them.
  - Make it easier to use a common material for the portcullis itself, since the
    chance of bits of wall flying off accidentally because there is redstone
    nearby is smaller if the power block has to be a rare block.
  - Slightly improve the performance of the plugin.
* Added new option to disallow "floating" portcullises, stopping people from
  sending portcullises off into the blue sky either by accident (because they
  forgot to build a lintel above it) or on purpose.

Version 1.2.9 - released 20-5-2012

* Support new solid blocks for frame (end stone, etc.)
* Ignore redstone current through sign posts and wall signs (this may or may not be a Bukkit bug)
